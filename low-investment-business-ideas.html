      <h2>10 Low Investment Business Ideas You Can Start Today</h2>
      <p><em>Practical, real-world business ideas that require minimal startup capital and can grow with consistent effort.</em></p>

      <h3>1. Mobile Phone Repair Service</h3>
      <p>Smartphones are essential and frequently need repairs — cracked screens, battery replacement, and software troubleshooting. A short technical course and basic tools are enough to start providing these services from home or through a small kiosk.</p>

      <h3>2. Home-Based Bakery or Snack Business</h3>
      <p>If you enjoy baking, start by taking orders via WhatsApp and social media. Offer a limited menu to maintain quality and scale up as demand grows. Focus on packaging, hygiene, and consistent taste.</p>

      <h3>3. Digital Marketing Services for Local Businesses</h3>
      <p>Many local shops need simple digital marketing help: setting up social pages, creating promotional posts, or running basic ads. With a laptop and internet connection you can offer monthly packages.</p>

      <h3>4. Tailoring and Clothing Alteration</h3>
      <p>Tailoring services — hemming, stitching, and alterations — are always in demand. Learn basic tailoring skills and offer pickup/delivery for convenience.</p>

      <h3>5. Tutoring and Coaching</h3>
      <p>Tutoring requires minimal investment: knowledge, patience, and a quiet space. Offer online or in-person lessons, and consider group classes to increase hourly earnings.</p>

      <h3>6. Grocery Delivery Service</h3>
      <p>Partner with local grocers and offer delivery to nearby neighborhoods. This service is especially valuable for elderly or busy customers and can be monetized per-delivery or via subscription.</p>

      <h3>7. Custom Gifts and Crafts</h3>
      <p>Handmade or customized gifts (printed mugs, T‑shirts, craft decor) sell well online and at local events. Use social platforms and WhatsApp groups to showcase samples and take orders.</p>

      <h3>8. Photography and Content Creation</h3>
      <p>Start with a smartphone and build a portfolio of event photos, product images for local businesses, or short marketing videos. As you grow, invest in better equipment and editing skills.</p>

      <h3>9. Cleaning Services (Homes and Offices)</h3>
      <p>Residential and commercial cleaning services have steady demand. Begin alone or with a small team, and offer specialized services like carpet or sofa cleaning to increase margins.</p>

      <h3>10. Reselling Products Online</h3>
      <p>Buy small lots from wholesalers and resell on social platforms. Focus on a niche (accessories, beauty products, kitchenware) and build repeat customers through good service.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Low-investment businesses succeed when you focus on reliability, quality, and strong local marketing. Start with a single, manageable offering; reinvest profits; and scale services as demand grows.</p>
